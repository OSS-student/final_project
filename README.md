* What does this project do?
  * This project reserve parking spaces online.
* Why is this project useful?
  * It would be really difficult if there was an emergency at school and there was no parking space when i came by car, so i went around the school or in the worst case, i went out of the school again and pulled  over and walked.
  * The project provides such people with parking spaces or at least it would suggest that they should use public transportation.
